#### A group project for the course "Game technologies and interactive system".

The objective of this course was to create an application, which is capable to create simple imagery with ray tracing. There were certain criteria:

*   The programming language was free to choose but preferably not a shading language as it comes with certain disadvantages.

*   The raytracing technique has to be implemented and fully functional. Engines fully capable of ray tracing are not allowed.

*   Two additional features of choice have to be added.

Me and a friend of mine, who had worked with me on this project, have decided to use Java as our language of choice. Java may not be the best choice when it comes to image generations, but the focus of the project was to implement the idea of raytracing on any language regardless of how fast or efficient it worked.

It features a primitive object system, a scene system, shading algorithm for objects and of course the raytracing system.

For our additional features, we have chosen to implement

*   Soft shadows for more accurate representation of shadows.

*   Refraction for support for transparent objects such as glass spheres or water.

*   SSAA (Super-sampling anti-aliasing) for the removal of aliasing artifacts.

Although the raytracing was not very fast (which we did not expect with Java anyway) we were suprised by the quality of our results.
