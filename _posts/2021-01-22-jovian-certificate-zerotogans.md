I have participated in the "*Zero to GANs*" PyTorch Deep Learning course which was hosted by Aakash N S on the platform "Jovian".

This course is a beginner-friendly online course that offers a "practical and coding-focused introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework" which included theoretical online lessons and practical assignments.

The themes covered in this course are:

1.  PyTorch basics and Gradient Descent

2.  Working with images and logistic regression using the MNIST dataset

3.  Training multilayered neural networks on a GPU

4.  Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

5.  Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), Data Augmentation and Regularization

6.  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transfer Learning

By completing all assignments, aswell as writing a final course project, participants of this course can earn a verified certificate of accomplishment.

##### Course project:

In my course project "Training the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset on a CNN (ResNet9)", as the title suggests, I have trained a model on a fairly small ResNet9 and achieved around 75% in validation accuracy, which is not bad for my first deep learning project. I originally intended to implement the ResNet50 architecture, but the implementation proved to be more challenging than I anticipated and time was sadly also an issue. This project can be found on my Jovian page.

Evaluation status of final course project: **Pending**

##### Further improvements:

Since then, I have tried to improve the accuracy on this dataset and tried different methods. In my latest work, I have used the "EfficientNetB0" architecture with the use of the fast.ai library in order to train the model. The EfficientNet model is a state-of-the-art architecture for image classification and object detection and promises better results while having a smaller network with fever parameters. With only basic augmentations, I could achieve around 91 % validation accuracy on this dataset, which is a big improvement. You can view the colab note book here or on my page on Jovian.

##### What's in for the future?

I definetly plan on experimenting and reading about different techniques and strategies. It would also be cool to implement one of the networks by hand, instead of just using one.
