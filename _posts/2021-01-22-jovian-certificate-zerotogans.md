I have participated in the "Zero to GANs" PyTorch Deep Learning course which was hosted by Aakash N S on the platform "Jovian".

This course is a beginner-friendly online course that offers a "practical and coding-focused introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework" which included thoreatical online lessons and practical assignments.

The themes covered in this course are:

1.   PyTorch basics and Gradient Descent

2.  Working with images and logistic regression using the MNIST dataset

3.  Training multilayered neural networks on a GPU

4.  Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

5.  Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), Data Augmentation and Regularization

6.  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transfer Learning

By completing all assignments aswell as writing a final course project, participants of this course can earn a verified certificate of accomplishment.

My course project "Training the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset on a CNN (ResNet9)" can be viewed on my Jovian profile page.

Evaluation status of final course project: **Pending**
