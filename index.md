      #### About me


      My name is Ruslan Novikov, 22 years old and currently living in Berlin,
      Germany. I am currently studying international media and computer science
      (Internationale Medieninformatik) at the HTW Berlin (Hochschule fÃ¼r
      Technik und Wirtschaft). In internation media and computer science we are
      mostly exposed to software design and development but with a slight focus
      on digital media like video, audio, imagery and CGI. Course subjects are
      for example image processing (image synthesis, convolution), 3D-design,
      game development projects in Unity and Unreal Engine and so on.


      I am generally interested in almost any develepmonts in the field of
      computer science, but more specifically in computer graphics, engine
      pipelines (and a little bit of shader programming) and most recently have
      been really enganged in developments in machine learning / deep learning
      specifically network architectures and optimization techniques.


      #### Academic


      The coursework and projects have exposed me to a wide variety of fields
      such as software development, databases, game development, machine
      learning and (a little bit of) networking


      #### Programming languages and libraries


      I have a generally good understanding of high-level object-oriented
      programming languages and also have share of experience in functional and
      also reactive programming. Here I have gathered the languages and
      libraries I have the most experience with and those that I work with the
      most.


      Programming languages:


      *   Java


      *   C#


      *   Python


      *   JavaScript


      Query languages:


      *   T-SQL, MySQL


      Libraries and APIs


      *   PyTorch (library for machine learning in Python)


      *   RxJava (library for reactive and asynchronous programming)
