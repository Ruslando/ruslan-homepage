      ### About me


      My name is Ruslan Novikov, I'm 22 years old and currently living in
      Berlin, Germany.


      I am currently studying international media and computer science
      (Internationale Medieninformatik) at the HTW Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr
      Technik und Wirtschaft).


      My interest generally lies in any developments in the field of computer
      science but more specifically in computer graphics and more recently, in
      developments in machine learning / deep learning. Specifically network
      architectures and optimization techniques in deep learing applications are
      extremely interesting.


      I have recently been working on course assignments and did some
      experiments on my own. You can read more about it in the portfolio tab.


      #### *Programming languages and libraries*


      I am experienced in high-level object-oriented programming languages and
      have a fair share of experience in functional and reactive programming.
      Here I have gathered a small list featuring some programming languages and
      frameworks that I confidently work with and have a lot of experience with.


      ###### Programming languages:


      *   **Java**, **C#**, Python, JavaScript


      ###### Query languages:


      *   T-SQL, SQLite


      ###### Libraries and Frameworks:


      *   PyTorch (framework for machine learning in Python)


      *   RxJava (library for reactive and asynchronous programming)


      ###### Software and Engines:


      *   **Unity**, Unreal Engine 4

      *   **PhotoshopCC**
          (mostly for digital drawing)

      *   Android Studio
