      My name is Ruslan Novikov, 22 years old and currently living in Berlin,
      Germany. I am currently studying international media and computer science
      (Internationale Medieninformatik) at the HTW Berlin (Hochschule für
      Technik und Wirtschaft). In internation media and computer science we are
      mostly exposed to software design and development but with a slight focus
      on digital media like video, audio, imagery and CGI. Course subjects are
      for example image processing (image synthesis, convolution), 3D-design,
      game development projects in Unity and Unreal Engine and so on.


      I am generally interested in almost any develepmonts in the field of
      computer science, but more specifically in computer graphics, engine
      pipelines (and a little bit of shader programming) and most recently have
      been really enganged in developments in machine learning / deep learning
      specifically network architectures and optimization techniques.


      #### Academic


      The coursework and projects have exposed me to a wide variety of fields
      such as software development, databases, game development, machine
      learning and (a little bit of) networking.


      For our project course, our team of six people has created an Android
      application which helps adults who have kids that suffer from anaphylactic
      shocks, give better and faster first aid and guide them through critical
      steps. This project won us 1st place (out of 6) in the bachelors category
      of the competition). You can learn more in the projects tab.


      #### Programming languages and libraries


      I have a generally good understanding of high-level object-oriented
      programming languages and also have share of experience in functional and
      also reactive programming. Here I have gathered the languages and
      libraries I have the most experience with and those that I work with the
      most.
