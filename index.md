      My name is Ruslan Novikov, 22 years old and currently living in Berlin,
      Germany.


      I am currently studying international media and computer science
      (Internationale Medieninformatik) at the HTW Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr
      Technik und Wirtschaft), which has a slight focus on digital media like
      audio, video, images, web-design and 3D design.


      I am generally interested in any develepmonts in the field of computer
      science, more specifically in (low-level) computer graphics, engine
      pipelines (and a little bit of shader programming) and most recently have
      been really enganged in developments in machine learning / deep learning,
      specifically network architectures and optimization techniques in deep
      learning applications.


      #### Academic


      The coursework and projects have exposed me to a wide variety of fields
      such as software development, databases, game development, machine
      learning and (a little bit of) networking.


      For our project competition, our team of six people has created an Android
      application which helps adults with children that suffer from anaphylactic
      shocks, give better and faster first aid and guide them through critical
      steps. This project won 1st place (out of six) in the bachelors category
      of the competition. You can learn more in the project in the project tab.


      #### Programming languages and libraries


      I have a generally good understanding of high-level object-oriented
      programming languages and also have share of experience in functional and
      also reactive programming. Here I have gathered the languages and
      libraries I have the most experience with and those that I work with the
      most.


      *Keywords marked bold are the ones I feel most confortable with and / or
      have the most experience with*


      ###### Programming languages:


      *   **Java**, **C#**, Python, JavaScript


      ###### Query languages:


      *   T-SQL, MySQL


      ###### Libraries and APIs:


      *   PyTorch (library for machine learning in Python)


      *   RxJava (library for reactive and asynchronous programming)


      ###### Software and Engines:


      *   **Unity**, Unreal Engine 4
