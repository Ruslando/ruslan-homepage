      ### About me


      My name is Ruslan Novikov, 22 years old and currently living in Berlin,
      Germany.


      I am currently studying international media and computer science
      (Internationale Medieninformatik) at the HTW Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr
      Technik und Wirtschaft).


      My interest generally lies in any develepments in the field of computer
      science but more specifically in computer graphics (and a little bit of
      shader programming).


      More recently I have been really enganged in developments in machine
      learning / deep learning, specifically network architectures and
      optimization techniques in deep learning applications.


      #### *Programming languages and libraries*


      I have a generally good understanding of high-level object-oriented
      programming languages and also have share of experience in functional and
      also reactive programming. Here I have gathered the languages and
      libraries I have the most experience with and those that I work with the
      most.


      *Keywords marked bold are the ones I feel most confortable with and / or
      have the most experience with*


      ###### Programming languages:


      *   **Java**, **C#**, Python, JavaScript


      ###### Query languages:


      *   T-SQL, MySQL


      ###### Libraries and APIs:


      *   PyTorch (library for machine learning in Python)


      *   RxJava (library for reactive and asynchronous programming)


      ###### Software and Engines:


      *   **Unity**, Unreal Engine 4
